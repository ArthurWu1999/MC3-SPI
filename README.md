# MC3-SPI
An SPI pipeline for simultaneous real-time tracking and high-fidelity imaging of objects under unconstrained 2D translation/rotation. It uses six optimized Fourier patterns with multichannel centroid tracking to estimate motion, then applies a lightweight inverse motion-compensated reconstruction.
